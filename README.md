kb is a Kanban Task Management software designed to provide an effect way to display project task progression directly in the terminal.

If you find this project helpful or interesting, please consider giving it a ‚≠ê on GitHub. Your support is greatly appreciated!

## Roadmap
- Release v1.0.0 provides the base of the Kanban task mangement software. It features the ability to create, view, and delete Kanban projects and do the same for tasks that are present within a project. Tasks are sent to the backlog and can be moved to the active board view.
- Release v1.1.0 provides pagination and view limits for the board and selection interfaces. It also opens up each of the task options - allowing for deeper customization.

## Contributing to kb
If you notice an issue with kb, please create an issue on GitHub for it. If you have a solution to the issue, please create a pull request and mention the issue. Likewise, if you find someone else opening an issue and you would like to build a solution for it, please do so! Just remember to mention the issue.

### Guidelines
- Follow the [PEP 8 style](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for writing your Python code.
- Create comment documentation for each new function that you implement / fix you make (if necessary).
- Prioritize readability and maintainability rather than being performance efficient.

Don't worry about getting the guidelines perfect. This is what the pull requests are for. I've probably messed up plenty on this too! üòÉ
